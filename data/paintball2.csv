During gameplay, if the User's Character replays a finished tournament, they do not appear to be awarded the full amount of credits.

Steps to Reproduce:
1) Enter Career Mode, then select Tournament,
2) Select any tournament,
3) Complete the tournament,
4) Replay and complete the finished tournament,
5) Observe the User appears to earn 0 credits instead of what was stated to have been earned.

Expected Results:

NOTE(1): Previously played tournament games appear to not award the User with any of the credits that it informs the User they have earned.
NOTE(2): As of the 10/22/08 build, if the user gets 2nd place in a tournament and then replays the tournament and earns 1st place, he will gain the full amount of 1st place credits. If, however, the user gets 1st place in a tournament and then replays the tournament and receives 1st place a second time, he will get no extra credits.

This design encourages users to purposefully finish all tournaments in 2nd place, and then go back and finish them all again in 1st place for extra credits.

If the user is given 2nd place in a tournament and he replays it again and gets 1st, he should only be given the credits he did not earn the first time around - OR - the user should be allowed to earn the full amount of credits per place every time he plays through, allowing him to accrue unlimited credits.","[Justin Westplate (AMP QA Lead) -- 10/23/2008 05:42:47 PM]
